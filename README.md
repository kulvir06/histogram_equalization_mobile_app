# Histogram_Equalization

A Flutter Project to calculate and display the Histogram Equalization Levels of given Gray Levels and its Frequencies

## Histogram Equalization - an integral part of Image Processing

Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram.

This method usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when the image is represented by a narrow range of intensity values.
Through this adjustment, the intensities can be better distributed on the histogram utilizing the full range of intensities evenly.
This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast. 
Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the highly populated intensity values which use to degrade image contrast.

## Implementation of Histogram Equaliztion

Consider a discrete grayscale image {x} and let ni be the number of occurrences of gray level i. 
The probability of an occurrence of a pixel of level i in the image is
